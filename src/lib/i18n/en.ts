    whatIsRagDesc: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a way to make AI assistants smarter by connecting them to your own data. Instead of relying only on what the AI was trained on, RAG lets it search through your documents, databases, or knowledge bases to give more accurate, up-to-date answers specific to your business.",

Typically this means: choosing an embedding model, setting up a vector database (like Pinecone or Weaviate), connecting an LLM via API (like OpenAI or Anthropic), and writing the retrieval logic. You control the architecture but rely on external model providers. Setup takes weeks, requires engineering.",
